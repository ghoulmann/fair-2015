Why Ubuntu?
=========================

By all accounts, for several years running Ubuntu was very consistently the most downloaded GNU/Linux distribution on record.

However, within the last two years, it began to be overshadowed by a Ubuntu derivative called Linux Mint. The popularity of Linux Mint in recent months offers insight into why Ubuntu is so popular, as well as where it's perceived to fall short.

A Summary of Ubuntu Assets
==========================

Ubuntu is a complete desktop Linux operating system,

* freely available and
* with both community and professional support.

The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the *Ubuntu Manifesto*:

* that software should be available free of charge,
* that software tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite any disabilities,
* and that people should have the freedom to customise and alter their software in whatever way they see fit.

.. note:: "Ubuntu" is an ancient African word, meaning "humanity to others". The Ubuntu distribution aims to bring the spirit of Ubuntu to the software world.

Contrast Ubuntu with the competition that's overtaken it: Linux Mint.

Linux Mint
===========

Linux Mint is an Ubuntu-based distribution whose goal is to *provide a more complete out-of-the-box experience by including browser plugins, media codecs, support for DVD playback, Java and other components.* It also adds a custom desktop and menus, several unique configuration tools, and a web-based package installation interface. Linux Mint is compatible with Ubuntu software repositories.

Thus, many recommend Linux Mint for users who are new to Linux and accustomed to the out-of-the-box useability of proprietary solutions like Microsoft Windows or OS X.

Conclusion
============

Ubuntu's former popularity had been a resulty of precisely what's made Linux Mint such powerful competition: useability out of the box. Clearly, Ubuntu has been outdone by an offshoot with a different philosophy, but the same functionality.

.. note:: In the computing program's lab at Chelsea School, we rely on various flavors of Ubuntu. We have not considered Linux Mint. There are several reasons for this deliberate decision:

    1. Ubuntu has an outstanding community of contributors that provide community support.
    2. Ubuntu has corporate sponsorship (Canonical Ltd) that guarantees that each long-term support release will be supported for five years.
    3. Ubuntu is unique in that it has a Code of Conduct that promotes good collaboration practices and citizenship for our student community.
