Appliances
===============

Appliances, in this context, are lean servers optimized to accomplish a single function with outstanding efficiency and strong security.

This program began with computing students creating appliances for distribution/publication for `Turnkey GNU/Linux <http://turnkeylinux.org>`_.

Over the course of a couple of semesters, Turnkey GNU/Linux picked up several appliances for distribution that were produced by students on the development team. A few are described below.

Sahana Eden
------------

`Sahana Eden <http://www.turnkeylinux.org/sahana-eden>`_ is an Emergency Development Environment platform for rapid deployment of humanitarian response management.

Its rich feature set can be rapidly customized to adapt to existing processes and integrate with existing systems to provide effective solutions for critical humanitarian needs management either prior to or during a crisis.

In other words...Eden built so that first responders can reprogram the software to suit the unique, critical needs of a humanitarian crisis as soon as their boots touch the soil.
