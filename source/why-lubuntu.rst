Why Lubuntu?
=============================

A few compelling reasons:

1. Requires minimal resources, which promotes compatibility with legacy hardware and lower-end machines.

2. All the support benefits of Ubuntu, including free community and corporate support for all approved software.

3. Small footprint - requires such minimal resources that it can run, functionally, entirely in RAM.

For those more comfortable with the look and feel of a proprietary OS, such as Windows 7 or OS X, Lubuntu can be easily modified to behave just like these familiar desktop environments.
