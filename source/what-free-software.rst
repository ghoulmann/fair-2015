What are Free Software and Open Source Software?
================================================

Free Software Summary
======================

Free software, software libre, or libre software is computer software that gives users the *freedom to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, modify, and distribute the original software and the adapted versions*.

The Free Software Definition
=============================

The free software definition presents the criteria for whether a particular software program qualifies as free software. From time to time we revise this definition, to clarify it or to resolve questions about subtle issues.

Originally written in 1986 by Richard M. Stallman, the Free Software Definition emphasizes two points:

  The word "free" in our name does not refer to price; it refers to freedom.

  First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you.

  Second, the freedom to *change a program, so that you can control it instead of it controlling you*; for this, the source code must be made available to you.

See `What is Free Software? <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>`_ at the Free Software Foundation for more information.

.. note:: Do note confuse *Free Software* with *freeware*. Freeware is well established to install malware, viruses, and adware on users computers.

Open Source Software: A Hostile Introduction
=============================================

From the Free Software Foundation:

  Another group has started using the term “open source” to mean something close (but not identical) to “free software”. We prefer the term “free software” because, once you have heard that it refers to freedom rather than price, it calls to mind freedom. The word “open” never refers to freedom.

Open Source Software Defined
============================

Open source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by anyone. "Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works.
