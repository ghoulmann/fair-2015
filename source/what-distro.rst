What is a GNU/Linux Distro?
===========================


Linux isn’t like Windows or Mac OS X.

Microsoft combines all the bits of Windows internally to produce each new release of Windows and distributes it as a single package.

If you want Windows, you’ll need to choose one of the versions Microsoft is offering.

Linux works differently

The Linux operating system *isn’t produced by a single organization*. Different organizations and people work on different parts.

There’s

* the Linux kernel (the core of the operating system),
* the GNU shell utilities (the terminal interface and many of the commands you use),
* the X server (which produces a graphical desktop),
* the desktop environment (which runs on the X server to provide a graphical desktop),

and more.

System services, graphical programs, terminal commands – many are developed independently from another.

They’re all `open-source software <what-free-software.html>`_ [there's that phrase] distributed in source code form and available for all to review and revise.

**Linux distributions** do the hard work for us, taking all the code from the open-source projects and compiling it for us, combining it into a single monolithic distribution you can boot up and install.

They also make choices for you, such as choosing the default desktop environment, browser, and other software.

 Most distributions add their own finishing touches, such as themes and custom software – the desktop environment Ubuntu provides as its default desktop environment, called Unity, is one example.

When you want to install new software or update to new versions of software with important security updates, your Linux distribution provides them in precompiled, packaged form.

These packages are fast and easy to install, saving you from doing the hard work yourself.

There are multiple different Linux distributions -- many hundreds. Visit http://distrowatch.com to understand how wide the range of Linux distributions is.

Many have different philosophies – some, like Fedora, refuse to include closed-source software, while others, like Mint, include closed-source stuff to make it easier on users.

Each includes different default software – like how Ubuntu includes Unity, Ubuntu derivatives include other desktop environments, Fedora includes GNOME Shell, and Mint includes Cinnamon or MATE.

 .. note:: Clearly, GNU/Linux differs from its proprietary competitors like OS X or any Microsoft Windows version in that you may switch desktop enviroments to completely and radically change how you interact with the computer. In fact, in our computing lab, students may choose and switch between more than five entirely different desktop environments.
