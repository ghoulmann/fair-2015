What is an Operating System?
=================================

Summary
========

An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory, processes, and all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.

Examples of Operating Systems
===============================

* Microsoft Windows 8.1
* GNU/Linux
* OS X
* Android
* iOS

The Jobs of the OS
=====================

A computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are many different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.

In Other Words
==============

Most operating systems have the following core roles in common:

1. manage hardware
2. manage software
3. provide interfaces for the user (such as a desktop or terminal)
4. manage users and their accounts
5. manage security
