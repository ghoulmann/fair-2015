What is Open Source Software
==============================

Prelude
=======
From the Free Software Foundation:

  Another group has started using the term “open source” to mean something close (but not identical) to “free software”. We prefer the term “free software” because, once you have heard that it refers to freedom rather than price, it calls to mind freedom. The word “open” never refers to freedom.

Open Source Software Defined
============================

Open source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by anyone. "Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works.

The open source initiative maintians an elaborated `Open Source definition <http://opensource.org/osd-annotated>`_ at http://opensource.org/osd-annotated.
