About this Project
======================

Concerns Addressed
==========================

* Not every student has access to a personal-computing environment on which they can experiment with assitive technologies or productivity software -- either because the resources are not available at home or because family members are reluctant to give their students effective access to the technology.

* Assistive technology vendors market products with a one-size-fits-all philosophy, rather than offering each student a solution that meets her individual needs and preferences for effective learning.

* Vendors work with schools to accomodate students to proprietary technology and to produce customers loyal to specific brands, products, and alliances.

Our Challenge
==============

Our team of student developers will collaboratively create a computing environment that requires no more of a financial investment than $8, but that offers assistive, educational, and productivity software that suits every Chelsea School studentâ€™s individual learning needs and preferences.


Project Summary
================

.. note::

    A live USB is a USB flash drive or a USB external hard disk drive containing a full operating system that can be booted.

    Live USBs are closely related to live CDs, but sometimes have the ability to persistently save settings and permanently install software packages back onto the USB device.

The team will create a USB drive from which Chelsea School students can boot PCs at home.

By booting from this USB flash drive, the students will have a broad collection of assistive, educational, and productivity software that will serve their individual learning needs and preferences.

The software will run on an operating system optimized for smooth operation -- even on older computers or computers low on hardware resources or with outdated hardware specifications.

By using this USB flash drive, students will have optimized work environments without affecting other family members' technology.

In other words, *booting from this USB drive will have no affect on the host PCs settings, configuration, or stored data*.



Project Objectives
===================

* Provide equitable access to resources for all students, including, but not restricted to, assistive and educational technologies -- not only at school, but also at home

* avoid one-size-fits-all approaches to assistive technology

* provide a highly customizable desktop environment to suit individual preferences

* provide a solution that requires minimal technical expertise or training

* prepare students to anticipate and work fluently and *flexibly* with  multiple - often competing - computing environments found in post-secondary environments.

* accomplish `Learning objectives <#learning-objectives>`__.


Learning Objectives
======================

The student will:

* install software packages from `repositories <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository>`_

* add to `repositories <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository>`_ available to the operating system

* differentiate system software from application software

* learn about different operating systems

* understand free software and open-source software licenses

* automate routine tasks by programming `shell scripts <#automated-package-installation>`_

Procedure
===========

1. Make an informed choice of a Ubuntu "flavor" that is best for this use case.

.. note::

  "The difference between the flavors are in the set of packages installed. However, all flavors of Ubuntu use the same repository for downloading updates, so the same set of packages is available regardless of which flavor you have installed. New flavors have to go through a process to become a Recognized Flavor" (Ubuntu Wiki). Learn about available Ubuntu flavors `here <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFlavors>`_.

2. Research and note the compatible software applications that would be ideal for the students Chelsea School serves.

3. Research and record the install procedures for each selected application.

4. Create an `install script <#automated-package-installetion>`_ to automate as much of the application installation process as possible.

5. Create a virtual machine with the chosen Ubuntu distribution as the operating system. [1]_

6. Download distroshare-ubuntu to the virtual machine.

7. Upload and run the install script from step 4 to run the automated install process.

8. Install additional applications that could not be scripted, such as Lexia.

9. Use distro share-ubuntu to create a disk image based on the finalized configuration of the virtual machine. The automated install script will put this in the virtual machine with no extra work.

10. Ensure the is installed on the virtual machine with the disk image that converts a disk image to a live USB drive.

11. Use the tool to write the disk image to a USB drive.

12. Test the USB drive: insert in a computer that is powered down; turn on the computer; select boot from USB drive on power up.

Obstacles
===========

* Lack of mature, English-language dictation/speech to text software for GNU/Linux in general and Ubuntu specifically.

  Nuance's *Dragon Naturally Speaking* seems to have a hold on this market. It's available for Windows and OS X.

Automated Package Installation
===============================

The following shell script - written in the bash language - is used to automate the installation of customized software packages for the purpose of this project::

    #!/bin/bash -ex

    # Checks to make sure program is run by a root (privileged) user

    if [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then
      echo "This script must be run as root"
      exit 1
    fi

    # downloads distroshare to tmp directory
    wget https://github.com/Distroshare/distroshare-ubuntu-imager/archive/master.zip -O /tmp/distroshare.zip
    # get from web public encryption key from the web | add the encryption key

.. [1] A virtual machine (VM) is an operating system (OS) environment that is installed on software which *imitates dedicated hardware*.

  The end user has the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on dedicated hardware; advantages of virtual machines include money saved on hardware, the reduced footprint of physical machines, and fine-grained security controls.
